  <p>
    Hey! I'm a senior technical artist and game developer who loves bridging the gap 
    between art and code to ship products that feel immersive and run flawlessly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work primarily within Unreal Engine, leveraging C++, Python, and HLSL/Shaders. 
    I care deeply about performance optimization, scalable technical art pipelines, 
    and tool development that empowers artists. My approach: build robust systems, 
    automate the repetitive, and optimize until every frame counts.
  </p>

 <p>
    Recent highlights include developing custom shaders and VFX systems, architecting 
    automated asset management tools, and optimizing graphics by implementing rendering 
    pipeline best practices to achieve stable frame rates without sacrificing visual fidelity.
 </p>

  <p>
    Outside of core development, I enjoy mentoring new talent, documenting complex workflows, 
    and building modular game systems that make development teams faster. Always learning and 
    always happy to collaborate on meaningful creative challenges.
  </p>
