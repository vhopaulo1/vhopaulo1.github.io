# SaaS API Starter

A comprehensive starter kit for building SaaS applications. This project provides a production-ready foundation with:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access.
- **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- **Billing**: Integration with Stripe for managing subscriptions and payments.
- **API**: Both REST and GraphQL endpoints are supported, complete with rate limiting to prevent abuse.
