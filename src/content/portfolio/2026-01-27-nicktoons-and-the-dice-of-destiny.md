### As Lead Technical Artist on **Nicktoons & The Dice of Destiny**, an action RPG featuring iconic Nickelodeon characters in a fantasy setting, I led the bridge between art and programming to ensure the technical viability of the creative vision. Beyond resolving production bottlenecks and ensuring that dynamic combat and detailed environments performed stably across all platforms, I was primarily responsible for the project's visual stylization, defining the technical processes that established the title's unique aesthetic. My role was pivotal in elevating the overall visual polish, implementing solutions that optimized the workflow and ensured the delivery of a high-fidelity product within the established timeline.

My responsibilities included:

*   Direct responsibility for visual stylization, establishing the final technical look of the game and ensuring aesthetic cohesion across various Nickelodeon universes.
    
*   Technical leadership in the creation of visual effects (VFX) and the development of advanced materials and shaders for characters and environments.
    
*   Configuration and adjustment of lighting systems and post-processing to maintain the franchise's vibrant visual identity.
    
*   Development of custom tools to optimize the production pipeline and streamline the work of environment and character artists.
    
*   Implementation of animation systems and a dedicated focus on game "juice," ensuring satisfying visual and audio feedback during combat and interactions.
    
*   Deep performance optimization to guarantee stable frame rates across different hardware and consoles.
    
*   Management of complex technical bugs and debugging of integration issues between assets and the engine.
    
*   Direct collaboration with art direction and engineering to align technical constraints with the game's aesthetic goals.
